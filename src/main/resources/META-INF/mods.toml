ComplexLife is a mod that, in addition to automation, is intended to make life in Minecraft a little
more complex. In addition to the possibilities for power generation, item and fluid transport, and
the automation processes possible with it, this mod should give the player the opportunity to build
more complex constructions, where you first build a floor plan, lay cables and pipes in walls and
thus space-saving his production facilities, houses, etc. placed in the world. The goal is large and
complex possibilities in a small space but with all the freedom and possibilities that you love in
Minecraft.

It should not only make things easier and more space-saving, but also more realistic.
In addition to the simplification through automation, the way there should not be given:
Recipes should become more complicated and initial production possibilities more difficult to
make life not too easy despite automation.

In the spirit of TheComplex I try to create this mod so that it fits comfortably into the world of
Minecraft and have the goal to create a mod that could also come from the developers of Minecraft
personally.

This is my first mod, and the current state is a very early preview that is far from everything
I plan to include. But the principles of the energy system are there, and the first beginnings of
some other ideas can be seen.

Even if it is currently not very playable: Have fun :)
